# Go JB Eat Lok Lok? 

Singapore is connected to Peninsular Malaysia via two Causeway Bridges. I, along with many Singaporeans, enjoy travelling to Malaysia for a nice meal, which includes the *Lok-Lok*, which basically is skewered meats and vegetables that is served with delicious dips. 

However, the traffic conditions between both countries can be terrible. I've built this app to get snapshots of the current conditions of (one of) the Causeway.

I'm making use of public API from our country's dataset to retrieve the information.

### Notes
I built this app before the Year 2020. Currently there are restrictions in travelling between both countries (except for import or export of food / services), so the Causeway Bridge is very clear of traffic.

### Improvements to work on: 
1. Use Javascript instead of the JQuery library.
